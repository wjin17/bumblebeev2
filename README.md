## Project structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public                  # Put your assets here, e.g., images, sitemap, robots.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heroes          # big sections
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout          # site container
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation      # sidebar items
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tapas           # random components
‚îÇ       ...
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages               # path becomes route on website
‚îÇ   ...
...
```

### Components

The heroes folder contains the sections that go on pages

Add an item to the LINKS variable in navigation/Sidebar to add a link to the sidebar

### Pages

File paths become routes

pages/things/something.tsx &rarr; bumblebeeplayspace.com/things/something

You can also use the Head tag from nextjs to edit the head tag in the rendered html for SEO, titles, icons, etc

### API

Apis are much easier now. All files in pages/api become api routes with the same routing rules as pages except they are prepending with /api

## Deployment

Just link the project to the repo, add environment variables, and it should automatically handle everything.
